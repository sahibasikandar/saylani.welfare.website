        <li><b>Medical institutions of Saylani</b><br>With its offices in Nottingham, UK, Saylani Welfare raises funds,
            as well as raising awareness of a range of charity projects. Services by Saylani (NGO) are provided free of
            cost. It offers the following medical services at the following facilities:

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Charitable initiatives</b><br>Saylani, since its inception, has worked on both providing needed economic
            and nutritional help to the needy in distress as well as providing means for able-bodied persons to earn a
            living through innovative solutions to "tackle the root causes and effects of poverty of Pakistani
            citizens." This ranges anywhere from programs similar to those provided by Social Security in Western
            nations to doing area to area and neighborhood to neighborhood searches of the needy and providing relief.
        </li>
        <li><b>Roti Bank</b><br>The Roti Bank provides free meals to needy families in a simple walk-up kiosk along a
            main thoroughfare in Karachi. After providing their identification, details of family size (via birth
            certificates) and getting the Saylani "Free Food Card", the families can get 2 meals per day for a
            month. The initiative was launched on 14 August 2018</li>
        <li><b>Economic empowerment</b><br>In 2013, in an effort to create economic empowerment via training in
            Technology, especially Web and Mobile App development, Saylani Welfare International Trust began its Saylani
            Mass IT Training (SMIT) Program under the guidance of Zia Ullah Khan,[11] who have previously run successful
            mass IT programs like “Operation Badar”.[12] The goal of SMIT was to create 10,000 well-trained Web and
            Mobile App developers in emerging programming languages like React, Node JS, and Angular JS.[13] The program
            thus far has trained 4,000 developers successfully in fields as varied as Cisco’s CCNA certification,
            Graphic Design, and Startup Entrepreneurship along with the Web and Mobile App development skills to spur
            economic empowerment and allow its graduates to quickly become economically independent</li>

            providing food aid to Syrian refugees on Turkey's border with Syria. The Chief Operating Officer of Saylani,
            Muhammad Ghazal, said that they are working in partnership with the Turkish Disaster and Emergency
            Management Authority (AFAD) to provide aid to Syrian living in refugee camps near the border.[15]

            Saylani Welfare Trust also provides aid to Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.[</li>
